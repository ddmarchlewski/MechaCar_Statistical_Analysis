  The ground clearance and vehicle length provide a non-random amount of variance. 

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  The p-value is 5.35e-11. This is less than the significance level of 0.05%. Based on this information, the slope cannot be 0. 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
